INTRODUCTION                                    *vim-termbinds*

This plugin adds bindings to make `nvim`'s terminal behave like plain-ol'
`vim`.

WARNING: This is an experimental plugin. The idea is to get as close to
         plain-ol' `vim` bindings as possible, but I'm not sure if it's
         possible to get 100% of the way.

This plugin implements enough of the `vim` behaviour for my personal workflow,
but do raise an issue if something's wrong.


BINDINGS                                        *vim-termbinds-bindings*

The plugin tries to match the behaviour of `vim``s built-in terminal as
closely as possible. Have a look at `:h terminal-typing` inside of `vim`.

Some useful bindings:

    CTRL-W CTRL-W   move focus to the next window
    CTRL-W :        enter an Ex command

    CTRL-W .        send a CTRL-W to the job in the terminal
    CTRL-W CTRL-\   send a CTRL-\ to the job in the terminal
    CTRL-W N        go to normal mode
    CTRL-\ CTRL-N   go to normal mode
    CTRL-W " {reg}  paste register {reg}
                    Also works with the = register to insert the result of
                    evaluating an expression.
    CTRL-W CTRL-C   ends the job, see below |t_CTRL-W_CTRL-C|
    CTRL-W gt       go to next tabpage, same as `gt`
    CTRL-W gT       go to previous tabpage, same as `gT`

All other CTRL-W keystroke are treated as window commands.


OTHER CHANGES                                   *vim-termbinds-other-changes*

- entering a terminal buffer in `vim` sets the mode to whatever it was in
  previously. For example, if you use CTRL-W CTRL-W to leave a terminal
  window, then re-enter it, you'll be put back into terminal (insert) mode.
  vim-termbinds changes the `nvim` built-in terminal to match this behaviour.


ISSUES                                          *vim-termbinds-issues*

- Putting from the expression register in terminal mode with CTRL-W " = does
  not have syntax highlighting.
- Completion behaviour when using CTRL-W : is finicky.
